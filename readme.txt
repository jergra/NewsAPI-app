C:\dev\news-api-app 

This app is also on the second computer at:
    C:\webdev\news-api-app

    The plan at this time is to not necessarily update the second version.
    The second version is not on github.

Derived from tutorials:

Use NewsAPI to search for news articles of interest.
Enter a search term, or allow a random choice of one
or two search terms selected from a list of interests.
The list of interests: 
    src/data/terms.js

This app only works locally. For a deployed version to work 
it would be necessary to pay a monthly fee to NewsAPI.

start:
    npm start

update:
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push
